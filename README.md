## Airline Reservation System - Java Project

This project implements a basic airline reservation system using Java and SQLite.

**Features:**

* Reserve a seat on a flight
* View existing reservations

**Requirements:**

* Java installed
* SQLite database (included: `airline.db`)

**Running the program:**

1. Download the project files, including `AirlineReservationSystem.java` and `airline.db`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the files.
3. Compile the program using a command like: `javac AirlineReservationSystem.java`
4. Run the program using: `java AirlineReservationSystem`

**Database:**

The program uses a SQLite database named `airline.db`. The database schema is created automatically upon running the program for the first time.

**Limitations:**

- This is a basic implementation and does not handle features like flight availability, cancellations, or user accounts.
- Error handling is minimal.

**Further Development:**

- Implement functionalities for searching flights, checking availability, and canceling reservations.
- Enhance the user interface by using a graphical library like Swing or JavaFX.
- Integrate the system with a real database server (optional).
